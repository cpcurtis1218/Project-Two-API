## Technologies Used
In creating this API I used Ruby on Rails and the deployed app is hosted on Heroku.

## Planning and Execution
When first planning my application I created the wireframe and about a dozen user stories.  Once I felt good about the layout i built the API.  Once the API was completed I worked on the front-end functionality.  Once I was satisfied with the behaviors of the front-end I completed the styling.


## Current Issues
One issue is that Destinations are moved to the back of the list when they are updated.


## Future Additions
I would like to add a rating or preferences feature.  I would also like to add the ability to view other users' destinations.
